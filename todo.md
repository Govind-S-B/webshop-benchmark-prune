ADD TO DOCS : if a issue comes with docker volumes being downloaded and this causeing an issue , then just delete the prev dataset source and the entrypoint script will resolve stuff

ADDITIONAL SCRIPT : I could write an endpoint to iterate through the entire list and then get goals that are valid and their fixed urls ( this is for debugging )
