ADD TO DOCS : if a issue comes with docker volumes being downloaded and this causeing an issue , then just delete the prev dataset source and the entrypoint script will resolve stuff

add logic to skip to next session after 12 minutes , this is the timeout limit.

ADDITIONAL SCRIPT : I could write an endpoint to iterate through the entire list and then get goals that are valid and their fixed urls ( this is for debugging )
analytics api from portkey - contains time duration
next step in pipeline  write script to get both data and tabulate them , make 2 scores

shift to logic to load userids to process than using ranges , or a fallabcke to ranges if not resovled

file dump  reason of stoping as well - stop endpoint , full completion

add timeout support to API docs relevant to stopping , session id list for start endpoint supposrt add to API docs
