# Issue 1: Sessions Without Log Files are Ignored

## Description

In the `process_sessions` function, sessions without corresponding log files (`{session_id}.jsonl`) are entirely ignored. As a result, these sessions are not included in any statistical calculations or summaries. This could skew the overall analysis, especially if a significant number of sessions lack log files.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have entries in `session_details.csv` for which there is no corresponding log file in `observer_logs` directory.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe that these sessions are not included in the final report.

## Expected Behavior

All sessions from `session_details.csv` should be considered in the analysis, regardless of whether their log files exist.

## Actual Behavior

Sessions without log files are skipped and not included in any calculations.

## Suggested Fix

Modify the `process_sessions` function to include sessions even when their log files are missing. You can initialize default values for missing data and proceed with the analysis.

```python
# Inside process_sessions function
for session in session_details:
    session_id = session['session_id']
    trace_id = session['nfig_session_id']
    log_file_path = os.path.join(observer_logs_dir, f"{session_id}.jsonl")

    session_tokens = 0
    session_cost = 0.0
    session_page_visits = defaultdict(int)

    if os.path.exists(log_file_path):
        # Existing logic to process logs
        log_contents = read_jsonl(log_file_path)
        # ... process log_contents ...
    else:
        output_file.write(f"Log file missing for Session ID: {session_id}\n")

    # Continue processing even if the log file is missing
    # Initialize or keep default values for tokens, cost, page visits

    # Update tokens and cost
    portkey_info = [entry for entry in portkey_data if entry['TRACE ID'] == trace_id]
    for entry in portkey_info:
        session_tokens += int(entry['TOKENS'])
        session_cost += float(entry['COST'].split()[0])

    # Categorize sessions
    session['portkey_match_count'] = len(portkey_info)
    session['session_tokens'] = session_tokens
    session['session_cost'] = session_cost
    session['session_page_visits'] = dict(session_page_visits)
    all_sessions.append(session)

    if session['session_termination_reason'] == 'completed':
        completed_sessions.append(session)
    elif session['session_termination_reason'] == 'timeout':
        timeout_sessions.append(session)

    total_time += float(session.get('duration', 0))
```

# Issue 2: Potential Division by Zero in Success Ratio Calculations

## Description

In the `print_summary` function, the success ratios are calculated without ensuring that the denominators (`len(all_sessions)` and `len(completed_sessions)`) are not zero. If there are no sessions or no completed sessions, this will result in a division by zero error.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the script with an empty `session_details.csv` or with no sessions marked as completed.
2. Observe a `ZeroDivisionError` when calculating the success ratios.

## Expected Behavior

The script should handle cases where there are zero sessions gracefully, without throwing an error.

## Actual Behavior

A `ZeroDivisionError` is raised when attempting to divide by zero.

## Suggested Fix

Add checks to ensure that the denominators are not zero before performing the division.

```python
# In print_summary function
success_sessions = [session for session in completed_sessions if float(session['session_score']) == 1.0]
total_sessions = len(all_sessions)
total_completed_sessions = len(completed_sessions)

success_ratio_all = len(success_sessions) / total_sessions if total_sessions > 0 else 0
success_ratio_completed = len(success_sessions) / total_completed_sessions if total_completed_sessions > 0 else 0
```

---

# Issue 3: Floating-Point Equality Comparison in Success Session Filtering

## Description

The script checks for successful sessions by comparing the `session_score` to exactly `1.0` using the `==` operator. Due to floating-point precision issues, scores that are very close to `1.0` (e.g., `0.999999`) may not be considered successful, even though they practically are.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have sessions with `session_score` values marginally less than `1.0` due to floating-point representation.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe that these sessions are not counted as successful.

## Expected Behavior

Sessions with a `session_score` effectively equal to `1.0` should be considered successful.

## Actual Behavior

Sessions with `session_score` slightly less than `1.0` are not counted as successful.

## Suggested Fix

Use a tolerance level when comparing floating-point numbers.

```python
# In print_summary function
epsilon = 1e-6  # Tolerance level
success_sessions = [
    session for session in completed_sessions
    if abs(float(session['session_score']) - 1.0) < epsilon
]
```

# Issue 4: Missing Data Handling in Calculations

## Description

The script assumes that certain fields like `duration`, `navigation_steps`, and `session_score` are always present and contain valid numerical data. If any of these fields are missing or contain non-numeric values, the script will raise exceptions or produce incorrect calculations.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Provide a `session_details.csv` with missing or non-numeric values in key fields.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe exceptions or incorrect averages.

## Expected Behavior

The script should handle missing or invalid data gracefully, possibly by skipping affected sessions or substituting default values.

## Actual Behavior

The script raises exceptions like `ValueError` when trying to convert invalid data to float or int.

## Suggested Fix

Add error handling when converting strings to numerical values.

```python
# In process_sessions function, when adding session duration
try:
    total_time += float(session['duration'])
except (ValueError, KeyError):
    total_time += 0.0  # or handle accordingly

# Similarly for other fields
def safe_float(value, default=0.0):
    try:
        return float(value)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return default

def safe_int(value, default=0):
    try:
        return int(value)
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return default

# Use safe_float and safe_int in calculations
avg_timeout_steps = mean(safe_int(session['navigation_steps']) for session in timeout_sessions)
avg_completed_time = mean(safe_float(session['duration']) for session in completed_sessions)
```

# Issue 5: Inconsistent Inclusion of Sessions in Statistics

## Description

Some statistics, like total tokens and cost, are calculated only for sessions with log files, while other statistics might include all sessions. This inconsistency can lead to misleading results.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the script with a mix of sessions with and without log files.
2. Observe that total tokens and cost are lower than expected because sessions without logs are excluded.

## Expected Behavior

Statistics should be consistently calculated across all sessions or should clearly indicate the scope.

## Actual Behavior

Some sessions are excluded from certain calculations without explicit indication.

## Suggested Fix

Determine whether to include all sessions or only those with log files and apply this consistently across all calculations. If certain data is only available for sessions with log files, make this clear in the report.

```python
# Option 1: Include all sessions and handle missing data
# Option 2: Rename statistics to indicate they only include sessions with logs
output_file.write("Total Tokens Used (sessions with logs): {}\n".format(total_tokens))
output_file.write("Total Cost (sessions with logs): {} cents\n".format(total_cost))
```

---

# Issue 6: Potential Errors When Parsing Portkey Data

## Description

When parsing the `portkey.csv` data, the script assumes that the `TOKENS` and `COST` fields contain valid numeric strings. If these fields are missing or contain unexpected formats, the script will raise exceptions.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have entries in `portkey.csv` with missing or improperly formatted `TOKENS` or `COST` fields.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe exceptions during parsing.

## Expected Behavior

The script should handle parsing errors and skip or report problematic entries.

## Actual Behavior

The script raises `ValueError` when attempting to convert invalid strings to integers or floats.

## Suggested Fix

Add error handling when parsing `TOKENS` and `COST` fields.

```python
# In process_sessions function
for entry in portkey_info:
    try:
        session_tokens += int(entry['TOKENS'])
    except (ValueError, KeyError):
        session_tokens += 0

    try:
        cost_value = entry['COST'].split()[0]
        session_cost += float(cost_value)
    except (ValueError, IndexError, KeyError):
        session_cost += 0.0
```

---

# Issue 7: Assumption of Specific Field Names in CSV Files

## Description

The script assumes specific field names like `'TRACE ID'` in `portkey.csv` and `'nfig_session_id'`, `'duration'`, `'navigation_steps'`, and `'session_score'` in `session_details.csv`. If the CSV files have different field names or formats, the script will fail.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Use CSV files with different field names or additional spaces.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe errors or incorrect data processing.

## Expected Behavior

The script should either handle different field names or clearly document the expected CSV format.

## Actual Behavior

The script fails when field names do not exactly match.

## Suggested Fix

Either normalize the headers after reading the CSV files or document the expected field names and formats.

```python
# After reading CSV files
def normalize_field_names(data_list):
    for row in data_list:
        normalized_row = {}
        for key in row:
            normalized_key = key.strip().lower().replace(' ', '_')
            normalized_row[normalized_key] = row[key]
        row.update(normalized_row)

# Apply normalization
session_details = read_csv(session_details_file)
normalize_field_names(session_details)
portkey_data = read_csv(portkey_csv_file)
normalize_field_names(portkey_data)

# Use normalized field names
session_id = session['session_id']
trace_id = session['nfig_session_id']
# And so on
```

# Issue 8: Incorrect Bucket Ranges in Bucketed Results

## Description

In the `print_summary` function, the bucket ranges in the bucketed results section may overlap or have gaps due to floating-point precision, leading to sessions being missed or counted multiple times.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the script with sessions having `session_score` values at the exact boundaries of the buckets.
2. Observe that sessions with scores exactly equal to the upper bound of a bucket are excluded.

## Expected Behavior

Bucket ranges should be defined such that each possible score falls into exactly one bucket.

## Actual Behavior

Sessions with `session_score` equal to the upper bound of a bucket are not included in any bucket due to the `<` operator.

## Suggested Fix

Adjust the bucket ranges or the comparison operators to ensure all scores are included.

```python
# Adjust the bucket ranges to avoid gaps
buckets = [
    (0.0, 0.1), (0.1, 0.2), (0.2, 0.3),
    (0.3, 0.4), (0.4, 0.5), (0.5, 0.6),
    (0.6, 0.7), (0.7, 0.8), (0.8, 0.9),
    (0.9, 1.0), (1.0, 1.0)
]

for lower, upper in buckets:
    if lower == upper:
        bucket_sessions = [session for session in all_sessions if float(session['session_score']) == upper]
    else:
        bucket_sessions = [session for session in all_sessions if lower <= float(session['session_score']) < upper]
```

---

# Issue 9: No Check for Empty `portkey.csv` File

## Description

The script assumes that the `portkey.csv` file exists and contains data. If the file is missing or empty, the script initializes `portkey_data` as an empty list but proceeds without checking if it's empty, which might lead to incorrect token and cost calculations.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Remove or empty the `portkey.csv` file.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe that `session_tokens` and `session_cost` remain zero.

## Expected Behavior

The script should handle the absence of `portkey.csv` data and possibly warn the user.

## Actual Behavior

The script proceeds without indicating that token and cost calculations are incomplete.

## Suggested Fix

Add a check and display a warning if `portkey_data` is empty.

```python
# In main function
if os.path.exists(portkey_csv_file):
    portkey_data = read_csv(portkey_csv_file)
    if not portkey_data:
        print("Warning: 'portkey.csv' is empty. Token and cost data will be incomplete.")
else:
    portkey_data = []
    print("Warning: 'portkey.csv' not found. Token and cost data will be missing.")
```

# Issue 10: Lack of Exception Handling When Reading Files

## Description

The script lacks exception handling when reading files. If any of the files are missing or inaccessible due to permissions, the script will raise an unhandled exception and terminate.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Remove read permissions from one of the required files.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe an unhandled exception.

## Expected Behavior

The script should handle file access errors gracefully and inform the user.

## Actual Behavior

An unhandled exception is raised, and the script terminates abruptly.

## Suggested Fix

Add try-except blocks when reading files to handle `IOError` or `FileNotFoundError`.

```python
# In read_csv function
def read_csv(file_path):
    try:
        with open(file_path, mode='r') as file:
            reader = csv.DictReader(file)
            return list(reader)
    except (IOError, FileNotFoundError) as e:
        print(f"Error reading CSV file {file_path}: {e}")
        return []

# Similarly for read_jsonl function
```

---

# Issue 11: Incorrect Total Time Calculation

## Description

The `total_time` is calculated by summing up the `duration` of sessions with existing log files. This means that sessions without log files are not included in the total time, potentially underestimating the total duration.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have sessions without log files but with a `duration` value in `session_details.csv`.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe that the `total_time` does not include durations from sessions without logs.

## Expected Behavior

The `total_time` should include the durations of all sessions, regardless of the existence of log files.

## Actual Behavior

`total_time` only includes durations for sessions with log files.

## Suggested Fix

Move the `total_time` calculation outside the `if os.path.exists(log_file_path)` block.

```python
# In process_sessions function
for session in session_details:
    # Existing code...

    # Add session duration to total time
    try:
        total_time += float(session['duration'])
    except (ValueError, KeyError):
        total_time += 0.0  # or handle accordingly
```

---

# Issue 12: Missing Summary of Sessions Without Logs

## Description

The final report does not include any summary or count of sessions that were skipped due to missing log files. This information could be valuable for understanding data completeness.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the script with some sessions missing log files.
2. Observe that there's no mention of these sessions in the report.

## Expected Behavior

The report should include a summary of sessions without log files.

## Actual Behavior

Sessions without log files are not mentioned in the report.

## Suggested Fix

Keep track of sessions without log files and include a summary in `print_summary`.

```python
# In process_sessions function
missing_log_sessions = []

# Inside the loop
if os.path.exists(log_file_path):
    # Existing code...
else:
    missing_log_sessions.append(session)

# Return missing_log_sessions from process_sessions
return all_sessions, completed_sessions, timeout_sessions, page_visits, total_tokens, total_cost, total_time, missing_log_sessions

# In main function
all_sessions, completed_sessions, timeout_sessions, page_visits, total_tokens, total_cost, total_time, missing_log_sessions = process_sessions(...)

# In print_summary function
output_file.write(f"Sessions Without Logs: {len(missing_log_sessions)}\n")
```

---

# Issue 13: Potential KeyErrors Due to Missing Fields

## Description

The script accesses dictionary keys directly without checking for their existence. If certain expected fields are missing from the session data or logs, this can result in `KeyError` exceptions.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Provide data where certain fields like `'page'` in logs or `'session_termination_reason'` in sessions are missing.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe `KeyError` exceptions.

## Expected Behavior

The script should handle missing keys gracefully.

## Actual Behavior

The script raises `KeyError` exceptions when it encounters missing fields.

## Suggested Fix

Use the `.get()` method with default values when accessing dictionary keys.

```python
# Accessing page in logs
page = log.get('page', 'unknown')

# Accessing session termination reason
termination_reason = session.get('session_termination_reason', 'unknown')

# Update counts accordingly
if termination_reason == 'completed':
    page_visits[page]['completed'] += 1
elif termination_reason == 'timeout':
    page_visits[page]['timeout'] += 1
```

---

# Issue 14: Incorrect Handling of 'COST' Field with Units

## Description

The script splits the `'COST'` field by spaces and takes the first element, assuming the format is "`amount unit`" (e.g., "`12.34 cents`"). This may fail if the format is different or if there are extra spaces.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Have entries in `portkey.csv` where the `'COST'` field has unexpected formats like extra spaces or missing units.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe incorrect cost calculations or exceptions.

## Expected Behavior

The script should reliably parse the numerical cost value, regardless of formatting issues.

## Actual Behavior

Incorrect cost values are extracted or exceptions occur due to unexpected formats.

## Suggested Fix

Use regular expressions or more robust string parsing to extract the numerical value.

```python
import re

# In process_sessions function
for entry in portkey_info:
    # Existing token parsing
    cost_str = entry['COST']
    match = re.search(r"([\d\.]+)", cost_str)
    if match:
        session_cost += float(match.group(1))
    else:
        session_cost += 0.0  # Handle cases where the cost can't be parsed
```

---

# Issue 15: Lack of Logging or Progress Indicators

## Description

The script processes potentially large amounts of data without any logging or progress indicators. This can make it difficult to monitor progress or debug issues during long executions.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the script with large datasets.
2. Observe the lack of output until the script finishes.

## Expected Behavior

The script should provide progress updates or logging information during execution.

## Actual Behavior

The script runs silently until completion.

## Suggested Fix

Add logging statements or print progress indicators at key points in the script.

```python
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# In process_sessions function
for idx, session in enumerate(session_details, 1):
    logging.info(f"Processing session {idx}/{len(session_details)}: {session['session_id']}")
    # Rest of the code...
```

---

# Issue 16: Potential Performance Issues with Large Datasets

## Description

The script reads the entire contents of CSV and JSONL files into memory, which can cause memory usage issues with large datasets.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Use very large `session_details.csv` and log files.
2. Run the script.
3. Observe high memory usage or crashes.

## Expected Behavior

The script should handle large datasets efficiently.

## Actual Behavior

The script may consume excessive memory or crash.

## Suggested Fix

Process files in chunks or stream the data instead of loading it all into memory.

```python
# Modify read_csv to yield rows instead of returning a list
def read_csv(file_path):
    with open(file_path, mode='r') as file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(file)
        for row in reader:
            yield row

# In main function, process sessions as a generator
session_details = read_csv(session_details_file)

# Similarly, process log files line by line
def read_jsonl(file_path):
    with open(file_path, mode='r') as file:
        for line in file:
            yield json.loads(line)
```

---

# Issue 17: Hardcoded File Paths

## Description

The script uses hardcoded file paths, which reduces its flexibility and portability. Users need to modify the script to run it in different environments.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Try to run the script in a different directory structure.
2. Observe that it fails unless paths are adjusted.

## Expected Behavior

The script should accept file paths as command-line arguments or configuration parameters.

## Actual Behavior

File paths are hardcoded, requiring code changes to adjust.

## Suggested Fix

Use the `argparse` module to accept file paths and other parameters.

```python
import argparse

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description='Process session analytics.')
    parser.add_argument('--session_details_file', default='analytics_script/observer_logs/session_details.csv')
    parser.add_argument('--observer_logs_dir', default='analytics_script/observer_logs')
    parser.add_argument('--portkey_csv_file', default='analytics_script/observer_logs/portkey.csv')
    parser.add_argument('--config_used_file', default='analytics_script/observer_logs/config_used')
    parser.add_argument('--output_file', default='analytics_script/report.txt')
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Use args.session_details_file, etc.
```

---

# Issue 18: Overwriting of 'output_file' Content

## Description

The script opens the `output_file` (`report.txt`) in write mode, which overwrites any existing content. This can lead to loss of previous reports if the script is run multiple times.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Run the script to generate a report.
2. Run the script again.
3. Observe that the previous report content is overwritten.

## Expected Behavior

The script should append to the existing report or create a new file with a unique name.

## Actual Behavior

The existing report is overwritten.

## Suggested Fix

Open the `output_file` in append mode or generate a timestamped filename.

```python
import datetime

def main():
    # Generate a unique filename with timestamp
    timestamp = datetime.datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')
    output_filename = f'analytics_script/report_{timestamp}.txt'
    with open(output_filename, 'w') as output_file:
        # Rest of the code...
```

---

# Issue 19: No Unit Tests or Validation of Calculations

## Description

The script does not include any unit tests or validation checks to ensure that calculations are correct. This makes it harder to verify that changes to the script do not introduce errors.

## Expected Behavior

The script should include unit tests or use assertions to validate key calculations.

## Actual Behavior

No tests or validation are present.

## Suggested Fix

Implement unit tests using the `unittest` framework or include assertions in the code.

```python
import unittest

class TestAnalyticsCalculations(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_mean_calculation(self):
        # Test mean calculation with known data
        pass

    def test_token_parsing(self):
        # Test token parsing from portkey data
        pass

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

---

# Issue 20: No Documentation or Usage Instructions

## Description

The script lacks documentation or usage instructions, making it difficult for other users to understand its purpose and how to run it.

## Expected Behavior

The script should include documentation, either as comments, a README file, or docstrings.

## Actual Behavior

No documentation is provided.

## Suggested Fix

Add docstrings to functions and include a README file with usage instructions.

```python
def read_csv(file_path):
    """
    Reads a CSV file and returns a list of dictionaries.

    Args:
        file_path (str): The path to the CSV file.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries representing CSV rows.
    """
    # Existing code...
```

Create a `README.md`:

```markdown
# Analytics Script
