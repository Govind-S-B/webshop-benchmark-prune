# Webshop Website Benchmark Prune

original webshop repo pruned modified and dockerized for just agent test on website navigation and benchmarking success ratio
removed code for transfer, training, gym environment, etc.

TODO : Dataset size for small and large ( num products and num goals )

## Getting Started

clone the repo
```

```

run docker compose up
```

```

use the link generated by the observer to navigate

TODO : Commands

## Some concerns and other notes

Mirrors for data sources
Non version locked dependencies
Redundant data loading and indexing
dead code and dependencies left to be pruned

## Changing data sources and managing them

start with small dataset
move to full dataset once everything is working
adding data manually to data dir
changing environment variables as needed to avoid redundant data loading after full dataset is loaded

# Interfacing with your agent (modifying the observer)

getting task url
navigating to done page (wait)
getting stop command
getting next task url

# Making sense of the data

extracting logs and using observability stacks ( recommended : portkey/langfuse )

# Memory and other compute requirements

benchmark on all and small data sources


Uncateogrized
rebuilding index and downloady the spacy model
small code tour on how the system loads data and works and features such as synthetic generation that are broken , fixed url , random urls , etc
other data such as goals and their asin and fixed url
